    <p class="card-text" ">The production of meat has doubled
    in
    the 30 years from 1988 to 2018 and
    increased four-fold since the mid 1960s. And production is expected to
    continue to grow. By 2050, global meat consumption is projected to reach between 460 million
    and
    a staggering 570 million tons. 570 million tons would mean a consumption
    of meat twice as high as in 2008.</p>
