                    <p class="card-text" style="overflow-y:scroll; height:100px;">With the coming of the Industrial Revolution, humans were able to advance
                        further into
                        the 21st century. Technology developed rapidly, science became more advanced, and the
                        manufacturing age came
                        into view. With all of these comes one more effect: industrial pollution. Earlier, industries
                        were small
                        factories that produced smoke as the primary pollutant.</p>

                    <p class="card-text" style="overflow-y:scroll; height:100px;">The production of meat has doubled in the 30 years from 1988 to 2018 and
                        increased four-fold since the mid 1960s. And production is expected to
                        continue to grow. By 2050, global meat consumption is projected to reach between 460 million and
                        a staggering 570 million tons. 570 million tons would mean a consumption
                        of meat twice as high as in 2008.</p>

                        component to their survival! Overuse of freshwater
                        in household settings means there is less fresh water for agricultural use (which affects humans
                        on an food scarcity level), but many livestock species
                        rely on freshwater. Also, as we divert more freshwater from aquatic environments to supplement
                        agriculturally, many plant and animal species are threatened. </p>

                        Canada is the top per-capita energy consumer in the world! By becoming more energy-efficient, you not only pollute less but save money too.
                        Unplug computers, TVs and other electronics when you’re not using them
                        Wash clothes in cold water. Hang-dry your clothes when you can and use  dryer balls  when you can’t
                        Look for the Energy Star label when buying new appliances
                        Winterize your home to prevent heat from escaping and try to keep it cool in the summer without an air conditioner

At night, cover up well and lower your thermostat to 17 C. Sleep quality improves when the temperature is cooler. A house with a furnace is like a car that idles all day. Swap your furnace for a heat pump, which works by extracting heat from one location and transferring it to another
Install a programmable thermostat.</p>
