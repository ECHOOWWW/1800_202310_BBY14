    <p class="card-text">â€œBiocentrically, other species
            rely on
            freshwater besides humans as a vital
            component to their survival! Overuse of freshwater
            in household settings means there is less fresh water for agricultural use (which affects
            humans
            on an food scarcity level), but many livestock species
            rely on freshwater. Also, as we divert more freshwater from aquatic environments to
            supplement
            agriculturally, many plant and animal species are threatened. </p>
