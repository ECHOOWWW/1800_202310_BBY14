    <p class="card-text">With the coming of the Industrial
        Revolution, humans were able to advance
        further into
        the 21st century. Technology developed rapidly, science became more advanced, and the
        manufacturing age came
        into view. With all of these comes one more effect: industrial pollution. Earlier,

        were small
        factories that produced smoke as the primary pollutant.</p>
